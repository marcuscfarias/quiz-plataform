## 1. About this project

#### 1.1 Overview

This project is a full-stack Quiz Platform designed to create, manage, and take interactive quizzes with real-time scoring and analytics. It is built with a .NET Core backend and a React frontend, providing a modern, scalable, and maintainable architecture suitable for both educational and enterprise use cases.

The platform allows users to register and authenticate securely, create custom quizzes, add questions and answers, track performance, and review results. The system is designed with flexibility in mind, role-based access control, and a modular architecture to allow future expansion (e.g., gamification, AI-generated questions, and leaderboards).

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in end-to-end software architecture and cloud deployment, covering every stage — from backend API design and authentication to frontend integration and continuous delivery on Azure. The project is currently under active development, with new modules being added progressively following an MVP roadmap.
